- list three (or more) advantages from having a library as part of the standard.

- before adding code to standard library, concept is analysed and checked hardly, so the chance to gain better library is higher, when it is in standard then alone
- components in standard library are hardly used, so errors and vulnerabilities are found much quicklier, than in some outstanding lib
- if the library is part of standard library, than it used a lot and you can find a lot of help with it in community and use examples
