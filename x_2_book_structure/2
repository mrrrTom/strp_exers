- Briefly describe the design aims of C++ and comment on the extent to which C++ meets those.
Programming language design has two main goals: create tool instructing machine to act and tool to describe subject. So C++ creation aimed at second goal, trying not to loose first one completely.
After decades of interprise using of C++ it can be resumed, that goal was accomplished.

Also C++ saved C positions as low level language in industry.
