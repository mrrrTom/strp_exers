- List five libraries that you would have liked to be part of the standard

I don`t know C++ labriries outside the standard library as I don`t have interprice experience with C++. So I have some generic ideas about areas to have libraries in standard:
1. serialization. It is important and errors creating part for applications with business logic and spreaded systems.
2. error handling. there is diagnostic library in standrd library, but errors dealing is big and very important part for every application
3. benchmarking. very usefull thing for high loaded system
4. databases. mundatory part for most user applications
5. concurrency. there are a lot off tasks with concurrency, that are very complicated, errors generating and usefull, so it is opportunity for widening standard library
