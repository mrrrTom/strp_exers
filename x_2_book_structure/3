- Write an assay: What can a good programming language do for you and what can`t you expect it to help with?

First of all I`ll will try to figure out, what role has programming language in my job as programmer. 
Each programming language (each language) has some minimal knowledge and skills, that you should have to write correct programm.
And we have some branches here: technical programming, business programming. Because this two types of programmes have different priorities. 
For programming some business logic you have need for heavy using of abstractions. So here language can offer convnient OOP realization, for example C# has it, assmbler language does not.
But there are programms, which main complexability is some techincal challenge, for example infrastructure management applications. There you want to have simple tools for accessing desired instruments.
For example api calls, operating system calls and etc.
Third part is language syntaxis and semantics. Language can be logical, can be close to english language and etc, I think theese charectiristicst are from linguistics and from this part of view we can consider programming language as english or any other language, that we speak on.
And that is it. More tools language can offer with help of community and language users. For example C# has great ammout of libraries for all possible situations, or C++ has libraries for memory management.
